# Random Benchmarks

Sometimes I want to know more about performance of certain APIs. Ad-hoc benchmarks are lost and I canâ€™t come back to them, so this repo acts as a backup, but made public as it might be useful for someone.

## Usage

1. Clone it:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:kinday/benchmarks.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies. I prefer Yarn, npm would work but no lockfile for you.

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run a benchmark (with node `node <benchmark>.js`):

   ```
   node ramda-curry.js
   ```
